# SERSymposia
A collection of symposium proposals for past Society for Epidemiological Research meetings. Some successful. Some not. These are mostly intended to serve as examples for folks considering submitting their own symposium proposals.

Questions? Feel free to contact me at Eric.Lofgren@wsu.edu or on Twitter at @GermsAndNumbers. Or file an issue here.
